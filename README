For my Intro to Embedded Systems Final (EE120B @ UC Riverside), I built Atari's Avalanche arcade game using hardware and software (C language).

To build the hardware, I used a:
- Breadboard consisting of an LED Matrix to display the falling objects and a moving paddle on the bottom to catch the objects. 
- Joystick to control the movements of the paddle (Left or right).
- Atmega1284p chip performs the actions provided by the software/code. Ex: if joystick is moved to the left, slide paddle left on the LED matrix.

To build the software I used the programming language C.
